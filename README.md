# Excel-Cleaning-Dashboards
Cleaned bike buyers excel dataset and created dashboards to visualise different trends
- Situation: The original bike_buyers dataset included customer demographics, lifestyle attributes, and a target variable (Purchased Bike).
- However, it contained inconsistent formatting and lacked useful derived insights for analysis.

- Task: Prepare the dataset for exploratory analysis and dashboard reporting by standardizing values, correcting format issues, and engineering additional features for segmentation.

Action:

- Renamed values in categorical columns (Marital Status, Gender) for clarity (e.g., M ‚Üí Married, F ‚Üí Female).
- Added a new column Age Brackets to categorize individuals into age groups (e.g., Young Adult, Middle Age, Old).
- Verified consistency in fields like Education, Commute Distance, and Occupation, ensuring they're clean and meaningful for pivot reporting.
- Used the ‚ÄúWorking Sheet‚Äù to apply all transformations without altering the original data.

- Result: Produced a clean, structured dataset with enhanced interpretability for reporting and segmentation
‚Äî ready for insights extraction through pivot tables and visual dashboards.
